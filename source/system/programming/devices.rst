Device management
=====================================================================

Device management is the entry-point of system programming. Programs have to
know which devices are available to communicate with the user (graphic cards,
input devices, etc.) or with other machines (network cards, etc.).

In this chapter, we present the basic concepts and we show examples with simple
virtual devices provided by Linux. In the next chapters, we build on these
concepts and we show how to use specific device classes: display devices, input
devices, etc.
