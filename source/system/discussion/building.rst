Building And Testing
--------------------

Our approach allows us to quickly have a working prototype that can be tested in
an emulated environment (e.g., with ``QEMU``). Especially with the
:ref:`haskus-system-build <haskus-system-build-tool>` that automatizes all of
the building steps.

.. note::

   As a comparison point, building a minimal usual Linux distribution from scratch
   is very cumbersome as we can read in the "`Linux From Scratch
   <http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs>`_" book. A lot of different packages have
   to be downloaded from various places, patched, configured, built and installed.
   Even if our approach is currently far from being on par with a usual Linux
   distribution, we expect it to stay much more simpler to build.
